Where is xmlrpc1_7_8.zip?
-------------------------

To get the distribution not too big the original 
Delphi XML-RPC implementation from 

Clifford E. Baeseman, codepunk@codepunk.com

is no longer part of the contributions folder.

If you need it go to the SourceForge.Net CVS 
attic folder or get the old dxmlrpc distribution 
2.0.0 from there.
